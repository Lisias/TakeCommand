# TakeCommand :: Changes

* 2018-0808: 1.4.12.3 (lisias) for KSP 1.4.x
	+ Merging upstream changes:
		- Added OpenCockpit rear gunner seat  
* 2018-0801: 1.4.12.2 (lisias) for KSP 1.4.x
	+ Preventing Kerbals being "poofed" when more than one seat is being populated on a cockpit.
		- As by SXT's EAS-316 Meadowlark
	+ The second Kerbal drops to the ground, however. A proper fix is WiP at the moment.
